Conversion from latitude/longitude to containing H3 cell index
---

This operation is performed by function `geoToH3`. See the comments in the function for more detail.

The conversion is performed as a series of coordinate system conversions described below. See the page <a href="#/documentation/core-library/coordinate-systems">Coordinate Systems used by the __H3 Core Library__</a> for more information on each of these coordinate systems.

1. The input latitude/longitude coordinate is first converted into the containing icosahedron face and a _Hex2d_ coordinate on that face using function `_geoToHex2d`, which determines the correct face and then performs a face-centered gnomonic projection into face-centered polar coordinates. These polar coordinates are then scaled appropriately to a _Hex2d_ coordinate on the input grid resolution _r_.
2. The _Hex2d_ coordinate is converted into resolution _r_ normalized _ijk_ coordinates using function `_hex2dToCoordIJK`.
3. The face and face-centered _ijk_ coordinates are then converted into an `H3Index` representation using the following steps:

   * the _H3_ index digits are calculated from resolution _r_ up to 0, adjusting the _ijk_ coordinates at each successively coarser resolution.
   * when resolution 0 is reached, if the remaining _ijk_ coordinates are (0,0,0) then the base cell centered on the face is chosen for the index
   * if the remaining resolution 0 _ijk_ coordinates are not (0,0,0), then a lookup operation is performed to find the appropriate base cell and the required rotation (if any) to orient the cell in that base cell's coordinate system. The index is then translated and rotated into the coordinate system centered on the new base cell.
