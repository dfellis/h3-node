# H3-Node

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dfellis/h3-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dfellis/h3-node) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

H3 Bindings to Node using N-API

## Install

To install this package, you need several development tools available: `git`, `gyp`, `make`, `cmake`, and a C compiler (`gcc` or `clang`). Once those are available, simply

```sh
yarn add h3-node

-- or --

npm i h3-node
```

## Usage

When fully implemented, it will be a drop-in replacement for [H3-js](https://github.com/uber/h3-js). For now, only the following functions have been implemented:

* `geoToH3`
* `h3ToGeo`
* `h3ToGeoBoundary`
* `h3GetResolution`
* `h3GetBaseCell`
* `h3IsValid`
* `h3IsResClassIII`
* `h3IsPentagon`
* `kRing`
* `kRingDistances`
* `hexRing`
* `h3Distance`

```js
const h3 = require('h3-node')

const h3index = h3.geoToH3(37.77, -122.43, 9)
const h3center = h3.h3ToGeo(h3index)
const h3outline = h3.h3ToGeoBoundary(h3index)

const res = h3.h3GetResolution(h3index)
const baseCell = h3.h3GetBaseCell(h3index)
const valid = h3.h3IsValid(h3index)
const resIsClassIII = h3.h3IsResClassIII(h3index)
const isPentagon = h3.h3IsPentagon(h3index)
const neighbors = h3.kRing(h3index, 1)
const threeRings = h3.kRingDistances(h3index, 3)
const ring2Away = h3.hexRing(h3index, 2)
const hexDistance h3.h3Distance(h3index, h3.geoToH3(38.88, -122.34, 9))
```

## Why another H3 for Node?

`h3-js` is an emscripten transpilation of the H3 code into Javascript with a Javascript wrapper file similar to a binding in spirit to handle calling these quasi-C functions for you.

Being 100% javascript it works across the entire Javascript ecosystem (especially when paired with browserify or babel to handle the Node-isms for non-Node JS environments), but that portability comes at a cost in performance. Preliminary benchmarks show a significant speedup with the N-API approach:

```

yarn run v1.12.3
$ nodeunit test

`h3-node` is a [Node N-API binding](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html) of the [original C H3 code](https://github.com/uber/h3) to provide a higher-performance option in backend Node.js applications.

That makes `h3-node` a "nice to have" but not as required as `h3-js`. (In a similar vein, I intend to write an `h3-wasm` for higher-performance H3 in modern browsers that can be a drop-in replacement for `h3-js` when WebAssembly is present.)
